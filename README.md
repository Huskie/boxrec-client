# boxrec-client ðŸ¥Š
A BoxRec client which fetches data from the BoxRec boxing website via web scraping in Node.js. Fetches return promise objects which will resolve with the fetched data if successful.

## To run

Firstly, install the module

```javascript
npm install boxrec-client --save-dev
```

Require the module using the following command:

```javascript
var boxrecClient = require('boxrec-client');
```

Now use the following command to request a boxer's details. The function returns a promise which will resolve with the boxer details when fetch is complete:

```javascript
boxrecClient.getBoxerById('474').then((boxer) => {
  console.log(boxer);
});
